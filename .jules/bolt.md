## 2024-04-25 — Optimize DAG Execution Engine `_run_node` by replacing manual check loop with `asyncio.wait`

Learning:
In asynchronous programming with `asyncio`, doing manual checks like `if task.done(): res = task.result()` followed by `else: pending_set.add(task)` before using `asyncio.wait` introduces Python-level overhead and duplicates error-checking logic. `asyncio.wait` is implemented in C and can natively and safely evaluate sets of tasks, whether they are already complete or pending, handling the queue much more efficiently.

Action:
Always delegate state evaluation for sets of asyncio Futures/Tasks directly to `asyncio.wait` rather than pre-filtering or manual synchronous probing, eliminating redundant Python-level logic and keeping loops simpler and faster.
